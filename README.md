# Number Recognition using MATLAB

Number recognition is a crucial task in various fields such as computer vision, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. In this project, we present a number recognition tool implemented in MATLAB that uses image processing techniques to analyze the cavities of each number from 0 to 9. The tool is able to detect the numbers using several methods and provides the detected number and the time taken for detection as output.

# Information


This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of number recognition using image processing techniques. It analyzes the cavities of each number from 0 to 9, and studies the surface area of the cavities to detect the numbers using four methods: nearest centroid and Euclidean distance, nearest centroid and Manhattan distance, k-nearest neighbors with k=1 and Euclidean distance, k-nearest neighbors with k=1 and Manhattan distance. The correlation method was also tried.

# Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository onto your local machine.
2.  Open the MATLAB project in the repository folder.
3.  Run the main script `detection.m` to start the program.


# Usage


1.  Select an image file containing a number from the prompt.
2.  The program will display the original image and the processed image with the detected number highlighted.
3.  The detected number and the time taken for detection will also be displayed in the command window.

# Credits

-   The main script `detection.m` and supporting functions were developed by me and [EILCO](https://eilco.univ-littoral.fr/) students.
- This project makes use of the [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html) in MATLAB.
